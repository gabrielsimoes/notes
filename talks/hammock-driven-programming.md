- Bugs are much cheaper to solve during design.
- _Solve Problem_ x _Create Features_
- Features are results, not objectives.
- Solving the problem is what matters

1. State the problem: say it out loud or write it down.
2. Understand: facts, context, constraints.
  - What you don't know?
  - Related problems out there?
3. Discern
  - Problems & tradeoffs in your solutions: technical, logical
  - There should be questions
  - More input the better: literature, search other solutions.
4. Focus
  - Get away from computer
  - Tradeoffs: balls will be dropped
5. Waking Mind x Background Mind
  - Waking should feed Background.
  - Make a problem  a days' agenda to feed it into your background.
  - Analyze Background output with Waking.
6. There is a 7+-2 concorruent problem limit on the mind.
  - Write the problem down, possibly with pictures.
7. Hammock time: NO INPUT! Close your eyes - recall the problem in your imagination.
8. Wait before getting to work.
